Every game ask three questions and if all your answers are right, it tells that you have won the games.
If you give wrong answer, the game ends and you can run it again.


The games are:
-Even-game, where you should answer if the digit shown is even or not.
-Finding the greatest common divisor among two shown digits.
-Progression. A list of numbers is shown you, but one digit is missing. You type missing digit.
-Prime numbers. You should tell whether shown number is prime or not.
-Calculator. There you should solve an expression.
	

Installation:
-Save dist folder on your computer and run $make package-install
-After package is installed, run any of the following commands through console.
-brain-calc to run calculator game.
-brain-progression to run find-missing-number in progression list game.
-brain-even to run game where you should choose whether the shown number is even or not.
-brain-gcd runs the greatest common divisor game.
-brain-prime runs game where you should answer if shown number is prime or not.
